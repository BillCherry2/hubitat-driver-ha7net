# To Do Items

## Near Term Enhancements

* When recreating child devices, support an option to retain existing Device Name and Device Label values.

* Do more testing of AAG TAI-8540 combined humidity and temperature sensors so that we better understand whether or not these devices always use the same 1-Wire ID for both humidity and temperature readings. 

## Longer Term Enhancements

* Exercise standalone testing - https://community.hubitat.com/t/unit-testing-groovy-apps-and-drivers/3691/14

* Obtain an OW-Server device and extend these drivers to support it.
